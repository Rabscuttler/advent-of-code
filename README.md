Advent of Code  
2022: python  
2023: python  
2024: rust  


## 2024
Some inspiration here: https://github.com/jamincan/aoc2024/blob/main/src/day1.rs  
Should we use the AOC runner? What are the benefits?  

`cargo test` to run the test cases  
`cargo run` to find the solutions  

### Notes
Don't commit the puzzle inputs.

> please don't go on a quest to collect many or all of the inputs for every puzzle. Doing so makes it that much easier for someone to clone and steal the whole site. I put tons of time and money into Advent of Code, and the many inputs are one way I prevent people from copying the content.
